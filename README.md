# GestRecognizer
Hi! I'm Ram Kartikeya. I go by the sm name thekinggpin :p
This project is particularly entitled to classify and recognize hand gestures in real time (via a web camera) using the data set that was used to train a Deep Learning model (Convolutional Neural Network). Posture datasets that are used by the this project can be generated by anyone by using the separate data generator module Iâ€™ve created.

How to make it work:
    
  First RUN 'generatedata.py'  
        You can alter the number of datasets here; including the test train split. i used 100:500  i.e 20% to test. Capture data using green box.
        
  After you get the datasets stored in the folder, RUN 'cnn train.py' this trains the cnn.
  
  Then RUN 'main.py' for realtime classification
